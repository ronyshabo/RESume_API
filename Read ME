Welcome to my first full standalone project.
I will demonstrate the API I am building using FastAPI 
in addition I am connecting it to SQLalchecmy database

To start make sure you set Up ssh correctly then clone the repo.
1- make sure you have the venv initalized then activated
   $ pip install virtualenv

   I used api_venv as a name and so activating it becomes:
   $ source api_venv/scripts/activate
   
2- setup Uvicorn, then run locally 
   $ pip install uvicorn
   
   Run Uvicorn locally using
   $uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   
   * this --reload flag helps your application update and run everytime you do a change, 
  and it reflects directly to the API

   keep in mind that main.py has been migrated to app directory
   Hense the app.main:app command

3- setup a .env file inside your API directory. and provice the following values
   DB_HOSTNAME=
   DB_PORT= 
   DB_PASSWORD= 
   DB_NAME=
   DB_USERNAME="by default postgress sets it as postgress"
   SECRET_KEY=find a secret Key and this would be yours to keep secure
   ALGORITHM="Type of Algorithm yiou would prefer to you. HS256 is my personal choice"
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_TIME="Per Minutes","This will decide how many mins the session for each log in"

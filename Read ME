Welcome to my first full standalone project.
I will demonstrate the API I am building using FastAPI 
in addition I am connecting it to SQLalchecmy database

To start make sure you set Up ssh correctly then clone the repo.
1- make sure you have the venv initalized then activated
   $ pip install virtualenv

   I used api_venv as a name and so activating it becomes:
   $ source api_venv/scripts/activate
   
2- setup Uvicorn, then run locally 
   $ pip install uvicorn
   
   Run Uvicorn locally using
   $uvicorn app.main:app --reload
